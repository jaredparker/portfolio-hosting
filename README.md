# Portfolio - Hosting

A microservice that handles the automatic launching and serving of projects based of user traffic and pre-configured launch times.

It utilises [portfolio-db](https://github.com/jaredparker/portfolio-db) to retrieve project configurations and is used within [portfolio-infrastructure](https://github.com/jaredparker/portfolio-infrastructure) as a Docker image.

The working implementation can be found at [jaredparker.dev](https://by.jaredparker.dev).
